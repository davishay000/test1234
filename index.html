  <h4> I enjoy playing and watching sports first it was T-ball then it was softball then it was basketball then it was cross-country now tennis. However I enjoy watching football and basketball the most unless it's the olympics, then I find bobsleding, fingurskating and sycnronized swimming fairly entertaining. However skiing the sport I always come back to both downhill and crosscountry </h4>
